#Upon touch in, check if a journey is in progress?* a new journey is created, and set to "in progress" with an entry station.
#Upon touch out, check if no journey is in progress?** we take an exit station argument, and add that variable to the journey class.
#Lastly, the journey class will create a hash using the entry and exit stations.
#That hash will be added to the journeys array in the card.

#*If a journey is already in progress when attempting to touch in, no new journey is created. And a penalty is added to the existing one, and it is then archived.
