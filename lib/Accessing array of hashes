# I want to extract every unique value from the key entry_station
# I want to turn those unique values into keys

#-----------------

# I want to map the exit stations from my original ///hashes within an array// onto the new keys - AS ARRAY ITEMS

# Puts the key and values in the array stored therein

#--------------

# Make a new hash
# Loop through the existing array of hashes
# Use an if loop to identify IF the key already exists. If the key exists then append an exit station 
# assuming there are any others. 
# ELSE if the key doesn't exist, create it and assign the exist station as it's value
# TAKE NOTE OF THE SQUARE BRACKETS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU ASSIGN THE INITIAL
# EXIST STATION AS AN ARRAY

# oyster.journeys.each do |stations| 
#     if new_hash3.include? stations[:entry_station]
#         new_hash3[stations[:entry_station]].append stations[:exit_station]
#     else
#         new_hash3[stations[:entry_station]] = [stations[:exit_station]]
